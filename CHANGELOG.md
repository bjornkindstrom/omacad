# Changelog

Versions: 0.x while the feature set is still growing, 1.0 when Omacad is a complete and dependable CAD.
The version lives in `omacad/__init__.py`; every build is published as release `v<version>` (and as `latest`).

## 0.5.1 - 2026-10-11

### Added
- **Box selection in sketches**: drag a box on empty space (left to right = only what is fully inside, blue; right to left = everything it touches, green). With **Fillet** the box picks all corners inside it (then Enter = one radius), with **Offset** it picks the chains it touches. Ctrl+drag adds to the selection. **Alt+drag orbits** in sketch mode.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-11 (Fusion 360 parity step 1)
Not yet released as a build. Includes everything from 0.4.1 below.

### Added
- **Revolve** is a real feature now: profile, axis (a construction line / any line of the sketch, or the sketch X/Y axis), angle (360 = full, negative flips), One Side / Symmetric / Two Sides, Auto/New/Join/Cut/Intersect, live preview.
- **Include / Project face edges**: sketching on a face includes its outline (lines, full circles, arcs) as real, purple sketch elements - offset them, trim them, snap to them, draw on them. Toggle "Include Face Edges" in the sketch palette; the **Project (edges)** button includes in-plane body edges in any sketch.
- Hole feature in the model (simple / counterbore / countersink, flat or 118 deg tip, through); dialog and placement come next.

### Changed
- Arrow handles (extrude etc.): the grab area follows the drawn head with a margin and a ring marks the grab point.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-10-11

### Added
- Sketch Fillet: **Shift+click** picks several corners (click a picked corner again to drop it), then **Enter** or a plain click on one more corner asks for one radius with live preview. One undo step.

- Sketch **Offset** works like Fusion: press O (or the ribbon button), a click takes the whole connected chain, click more curves to add (click a picked chain again to drop it, Alt+click = one element), Enter or right-click asks for the distance with live preview (negative = inward).

### Fixed
- Sketch selection: Shift+click used to pan instead of selecting, and Ctrl+click toggled twice. Both now add/remove one element.
- Rounded vertical corner standing on a lower step (stairs): a hairline notch was cut into the lower surface, drawn as a square corner outline round the rounded foot. The fillet tool now only reaches past an edge end where there is open space.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-11
First numbered version.

### Added
- Sketch **Trim** (T): remove the piece of a line, circle or arc up to the nearest crossings (dangling stubs too).
- Sketch **Mirror** (Shift+M): pick shapes, then a line or an origin axis.
- Pattern/Mirror: mirror steps across an origin or offset plane.
- **Shell** directions: Inside, Outside, Both (separate thickness each).
- Fillet/Chamfer edge picking: X / Alt see-through, Shift+double-click loop on the other face, Ctrl+click removes, Backspace undoes, Ctrl+Backspace clears.
- Version shown in the title bar and About dialog.

### Fixed
- Shell crashed on OK; Move Body dialog crashed on open.
- Fillet/Chamfer: mild bends in an extruded outline were taken for curved surfaces (walls not pickable); edges that moved after editing earlier steps were skipped (sharp edge left behind); inside corners of a bevelled outline got a notch; circle tools use the cylinder's segment count (half the triangles).
- Canvas image stayed the same when a new canvas reused an id.
- No demo "Base Box" at startup.
