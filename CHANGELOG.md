# Changelog

Versions: 0.x while the feature set is still growing, 1.0 when Omacad is a complete and dependable CAD.
The version lives in `omacad/__init__.py`; every build is published as release `v<version>` (and as `latest`).

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-11
First numbered version.

### Added
- Sketch **Trim** (T): remove the piece of a line, circle or arc up to the nearest crossings (dangling stubs too).
- Sketch **Mirror** (Shift+M): pick shapes, then a line or an origin axis.
- Pattern/Mirror: mirror steps across an origin or offset plane.
- **Shell** directions: Inside, Outside, Both (separate thickness each).
- Fillet/Chamfer edge picking: X / Alt see-through, Shift+double-click loop on the other face, Ctrl+click removes, Backspace undoes, Ctrl+Backspace clears.
- Version shown in the title bar and About dialog.

### Fixed
- Shell crashed on OK; Move Body dialog crashed on open.
- Fillet/Chamfer: mild bends in an extruded outline were taken for curved surfaces (walls not pickable); edges that moved after editing earlier steps were skipped (sharp edge left behind); inside corners of a bevelled outline got a notch; circle tools use the cylinder's segment count (half the triangles).
- Canvas image stayed the same when a new canvas reused an id.
- No demo "Base Box" at startup.
