"""Help & Commands: every function of the app, grouped as in the ribbon, with help text and search words.

The commands come from omacad.ui.commands (so a new command is in the help as soon as it is in the ribbon); MORE adds
a longer text where the tooltip is not enough, and EXTRA lists what is not a ribbon command (files, view, timeline,
constraints, ways of working). Text is English, like the rest of the app.
